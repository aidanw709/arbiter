This directory contains examples of using Arbiter to detect previously known vulnerabilities.

The vulnerable binaries are present inside `cve-binaries` directory and the corresponding templates used to detect the bugs can be found inside `cve-vuln_templates`.

The `cve-logs` directory contains the output generated by Arbiter when running the VD against the target binary.

Please refer to the README file inside `cve-logs` for an explanation on how to interpret the output.
