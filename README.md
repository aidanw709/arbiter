# Arbiter

Arbiter is a combination of static and dynamic analyses, built on top of angr, that can be used to detect some vulnerability classes.

All you need to use Arbiter is a sink that can be identified statically (like a call to a specific function), and a property that should not be violated at this sink.
Arbiter can then be used to detect if this property is violated at any of the corresponding sinks in the binary.

# Installation

Note: Run if you intend to run outside of a docker image otherwise you can skip this step

`sudo python setup.py build && python setup.py install`

# Docker image

Note: This program was executed using the ubuntu subsytem for windows

`docker pull 4rbit3r/arbiter:latest`

The coommand below will build and start the docker image

`make run`

# Running Arbiter

The following commands will work both in the docker image or if you are running outside of a container with the proper install

The command below will run all vuln templates against a given binary and save the logs

`./runall_all_vuln_templates.sh target_binary ./logs`

`python ./vuln_templates/run_aribter.py -f vuln_template -t target`

Note: This is the simpliest way to run arbiter. Passing -h will show other arguements

# Arbiter examples

This repository contains some examples of using Arbiter to detect different CWE types in the `examples` directory.

It also contains templates that were used for evaluating Arbiter on the Juliet Test suite as well as real world binaries in the `vuln_templates` directory.

# Arbiter Extensions

For the evaluation, the binaries tested are listed under the `evaluation` directory. `logs` contains a bunch of ran binaries and their outputs.  
Check the `toy_examples` directory for example programs for testing the CWEs in action.
